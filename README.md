### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Welcome to my persona. 

I like to write code for fun. What does that mean? Well it means that I explore programming languages that I have never used before. It means that I build game prototypes. It means that I solve coding challenges on leetcode. It means that I'm a bit of an enthusiast machine learning tinkerer. 

Here's some fun projects I've been working on recently. 

* Using Rust + WASM with threading to manipulate webcam images.
  * Live Project [HERE](https://happy-goldberg-e0d07e.netlify.app/) and explanation [HERE](https://github.com/richwandell/rust_wasm_webcam)
* Godot 2D Platformer [PLAY LIVE HERE](https://angry-lovelace-990c49.netlify.app)
